What am I trying to solve?


I want to know what is the likelihood of a Woman finishing her opponent
based on her previous finish rating. 

Factors to look at after:
- What is her style (Style/Wrestler/Jiu Jitsu)
- How many times has her opponent been finished?



Steps

Pick a past event

Go through each fight

	Retrieve the fighters involved in the fight

	Find their record and finish rate before the event
	
		Search the fighter name in Tapology

		Go through each link Tapology and double check that the latest event appears in their record
		to confirm if they are indeed the right fighter (In case there are fighters with the same name)

		Once confirmed, determine what their finish rate was before the fight.


	Determine if they won and finished the fight.
